# December-S2
December S2 is a datapack adding several new features to the main game. These include general behavior changes and new crafting recipes. It was meant to run alongside several Vanilla Tweaks packs, as well as Terralith, Amplified Nether, and Nullscape, and some of the features are meant to fix some farms that these mods break.
## Changes
 - Shulkers naturally spawn in the Chorus Heights and Chorus Grove biomes.
 - Skeletons that die of the Wither effect will convert to Wither Skeletons.
 - Burning a Nautilus Shell in Soul Fire will summon a thunderstorm.
 - The Lead craftng recipe now uses an Iron Nugget in lieu of a Slimeball.
 - Combining an Iron Helmet with a Scute in a Smithing Table gives a Turtle Helmet.
 - Combining a Golden Apple with a Totem of Undying gives an Enchanted Golden Apple.
 - Wool can now be decomposed into 2 String.
 - Nether Wart Blocks can now be decomposed into 3 Nether Wart.
 - Phantom Membranes can be crafted by combining a Feather with Bonemeal in a Crafting Table.
